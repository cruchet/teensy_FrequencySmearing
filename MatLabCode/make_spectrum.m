function [Y, freq] = make_spectrum(signal, fs)
%  
% This Function computes the complex spectrum of a signal as well
% as the frequency range of the signal.
%

% compute spectrum (note: it will be complex-valued).
Y = fft(signal);

% Shiftining zero components
Y=fftshift(Y);

% The FFT needs to be scaled in order to give a physically plausible scaling.
Y = Y/(length(Y));


% NOTE: If you do an IFFT, this scaling must NOT be done.
% Weâ€™ll get to this in the lecture. If you are only interested
% in the positive frequencies, you need to scale by <length(Y)/2>.

% Period of the Signal
Ts      = length(signal)/fs;

% Distance between the two frequencies
delta_f = 1/Ts;

% frequency vector
freq = [-fs/2:delta_f:fs/2-delta_f];


% NOTE: The first element that comes out of the FFT is the DC offset
% (i.e., frequency 0). Each subsequent
% bin is spaced by the frequency resolution <delta_f> which you can
% calculate from the properties of the inut signal. Remember the highest
% frequency you can get in a digitized signal....
% ...
% convert into column vector (if required)
Y = Y(:);
freq = freq(:);
